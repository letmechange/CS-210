# Flower Store

## *General Information*
Flowers in the store will have their own species, their own price and so on. This application will be designed to 
**show the information of various species of flowers** in a store. The flowers' information, included **its species, its 
price and its flower meanings etc.**, will be represented in a window when input the name of this required character. 
This application will serve for **anyone, who plan to manage his or her own flower store in a visible way**. The reason

# Phase 4: Task 3
I want to improve the model by rebuilding a bi-direction between Flower and Store.
It can decrease the complexity of code. Also, if there is more time, I will change some
public GUI classes to private GUI, like AddFlowerIntoStoreUI, since they are not accessed from one more class.
